INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS 

An interconnection network is used for exchanging data between two processors in a multistage network. In case of multiprocessor systems, the performance will be severely affected in case the data exchange between processors is delayed. 
The processors can access data from memory associated with another processor or from shared memory using an interconnection network. 
Thus, interconnection networks play a central role in determining the overall performance of the multiprocessor systems. The interconnection network is placed between various devices in the multiprocessor network.

VARIOUS INTERCONNECTION NETWORKS

Fully connected:

      This is the most powerful interconnection topology. In this each node is directly connected to all other nodes. The shortcoming of this network is that it requires too many connections
